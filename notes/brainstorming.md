Thanks II hate it

Should we respect Nick by having a 10 second long rhythm game gizmo?

Things:
Gizmos
Levels(1-5) - Higher Level = harder, "beating" the module levels it up.
Timing - Every 10 seconds takes 1 random level(above 1) from the pool of every level.
Punishment?
Victory? (Like getting all(25) modules to Lvl 5?)

Is the timer eating levels to unlock modules?

OK Game loop:
Player is working to level-up modules while the timer is working to eat the levels, wants to get all modules to LVL MAX to.... (Unveil an image of a cat behind them. Or something.)

Unlocking Modules requirements:
Minimum = 240 seconds = 4 minutes.

1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5

5 10 15 20 20
70 \* 10 / 60 = 11.66
